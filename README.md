# ðŸšš Day 3: Supply Chain Delay Prediction

This is the third project of my #30DaysOfAI challenge. The goal is to build a regression model that predicts the number of delay days for a shipment in a supply chain.

### âœ¨ Key Concepts
* **Regression with XGBoost:** Using a powerful gradient boosting model to predict a continuous value (delay days).
* **Feature Engineering:** Creating the target variable `Delay` by subtracting scheduled shipping days from actual shipping days.
* **Interactive UI with Streamlit:** Building a user-friendly web app to serve the model and make it accessible.
* **Real-World Application:** This model can help logistics companies to proactively manage shipments, inform customers about potential delays, and optimize their operations.

### ðŸ’» Tech Stack
- Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, Streamlit
